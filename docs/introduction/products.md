# Products

**Our core products**
---------------------

●       **The Treetracker mobile app** used by tree growers to take geotagged photos of the trees they plant and care for over time. These photos are uploaded to the cloud where Greenstand volunteers verify and assign an ecological value.

●       [**Web Map**](https://map.treetracker.org/) **and Admin Panel** displays verified trees on a GIS platform. This feature allows planting organizations to confirm placement and “health” of every tree planted.

●       The **Impact Wallet** enables investors and consumers to buy, sell, and trade Impact Tokens. This element of the technology ensures compensation to the grower.

●       The forthcoming **Tree** **Value Matrix** defines the payment in terms of ecological and social impact value. Higher value trees are intended to support higher payments to growers.
