# The Model

It is important to understand that Greenstand remains **non-competitive** in the tree planting space as a **technical service provider** to any project or initiative undertaking restoration work. Contributors should be clear that the Treetracker can be used on nearly **any project** around the globe to verify and maximize impacts. Our **customers are Treetrackers** who are using this service to support their project work. Our **target beneficiaries** are the rural populations typically residing in **extreme poverty** who are most often engaged to undertake **plantings and monitoring**.

Please review the valuable resources linked below to develop your understanding of the Greenstand project. These conceptual models will help you explain how Greenstand strives to make a global impact and brings transparency to the tree planting space.
