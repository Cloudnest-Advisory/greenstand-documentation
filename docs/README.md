# Overview

## **Mission Statement**

Greenstand’s mission is to create a global, open-source marketplace to digitally track and compensate farmers for growing individually-managed trees to support reforestation and alleviate poverty.

## **Goal and Vision**

Our goal is to create a self-sustaining restoration platform that connects local communities in developing countries with socially- and environmentally-concerned global citizens. Restoration efforts are informed, and adjusted, based on the results of basic ecological research.

We aim to enable communities to become stewards of their land while providing opportunities for gainful employment.

## **We envision a world where:**

●       Once-disenfranchised people can support themselves and their families through afforestation and participate in the global environmental credit market.

●       The global paradigm has shifted from tree planting to growing diverse and valuable forests.

●       All individuals, organizations, and donors growing trees can track and trade their ecological impacts.

●       Greenstand has created a standard for tree planting, growing, and reforestation value.

●       We can verify and watch trillions of trees grow.

## **Who we are**

Greenstand is a U.S.-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization developing open-source technology to address climate change and alleviate poverty through digitizing environmental goods and services. We are primarily a volunteer team. Our contributors are professionally skilled engineers, coders, data scientists, GIS specialists and operations associates from 6 continents. Since Greenstand was founded in 2015, we have amassed a global network of over 550 supporters in the form of past and present contributors, partners, and service users.


## **What we do**

We create open-source technology to track and verify restoration efforts. Our Treetracker app allows tree growers around the world to practice environmental stewardship and earn a living wage. The Treetracker app verifies and tracks individual trees, thus creating transparency in the reforestation sphere. Organizations and donors can locate individual trees and trade their ecological impacts. By facilitating ownership of trees and their ecological services, Greenstand allows for tree-growing organizations to stay accountable and transparent about their impacts.
