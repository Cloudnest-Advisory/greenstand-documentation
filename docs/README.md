# Overview

## **Mission Statement**

Greenstand’s mission is to create a global, open-source marketplace to digitally track and compensate farmers for growing individually-managed trees to support reforestation and alleviate poverty.

## **Goal and Vision**

Our goal is to create a self-sustaining restoration platform that connects local communities in developing countries with socially- and environmentally-concerned global citizens. Restoration efforts are informed, and adjusted, based on the results of basic ecological research.

We aim to enable communities to become stewards of their land while providing opportunities for gainful employment.

## **We envision a world where:**

●       Once-disenfranchised people can support themselves and their families through afforestation and participate in the global environmental credit market.

●       The global paradigm has shifted from tree planting to growing diverse and valuable forests.

●       All individuals, organizations, and donors growing trees can track and trade their ecological impacts.

## **Who we are**

Greenstand is a U.S.-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization developing open-source technology to address climate change and alleviate poverty through digitizing environmental goods and services. We are primarily a volunteer team. Our contributors are professionally skilled engineers, coders, data scientists, GIS specialists and operations associates from 6 continents. Since Greenstand was founded in 2015, we have amassed a global network of supporters in the form of past and present contributors, partners, and service users.


## **What we do**

We create open-source technology to track and verify restoration efforts, enabling tree-growing organizations and individuals to stay accountable and provide transparency.
The Treetracker app enables the tracking and verification of individual trees, thus creating transparency in the reforestation sphere; organizations and donors use it to locate individual trees and trade their ecological impacts.
The technical model is designed to support the green economy and direct farmer payments by facilitating 'claims of impact' from tree based ecological services and the trade and transfer of such claims as Greenstand Impact Tokens.
