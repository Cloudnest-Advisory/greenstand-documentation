The Wallet Admin Client aims to provide a user interface for accessing wallets and executing all known API calls for the Wallet API. Features include allowing users to administrate their own wallet, transfer tokens and create sub wallets.

To manage the creation of wallets and adding tokens into the end consumer clients wallet the Treetracker Wallet Admin Client is used to interact with the Wallet API.
