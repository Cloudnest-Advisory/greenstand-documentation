# Denormalized Data

With the growth of data on Greenstand, we are facing some challenges in the performance of our applications, including the web map and admin panel, so we consider denormalizing some critical data tables to solve the performance problem.

Some story and experiment on DB is here: [https://github.com/Greenstand/treetracker-query-api/issues/277](https://github.com/Greenstand/treetracker-query-api/issues/277)

The new database table definition is here: [https://www.figma.com/file/rbke28LussAy5VIp4rMsel/new-web-map-archetecture?type=whiteboard\&node-id=517-184\&t=advpqofQkoIa5z9x-4](https://www.figma.com/file/rbke28LussAy5VIp4rMsel/new-web-map-archetecture?type=whiteboard\&node-id=517-184\&t=advpqofQkoIa5z9x-4)

All tasks related to this project are here:&#x20;

Thoughts on how to redesign the database, the architecture of how all these work, and the table details of the denormalized table.
