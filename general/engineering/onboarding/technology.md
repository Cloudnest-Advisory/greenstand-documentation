description: The Greenstand tree tracking and impact trading tools are build as Open Source Products. To develop and operate the infrastructure as a service, Greenstand uses the following resources, technology, language and tools.

## Overview 
---
Greenstand's development revolves around technology to collect, verify, and trade claims for environmental and social impact. 

The primary Technology is comprised of:
- Mobile apps (iOS and Android) for field data collection. These Treetracker apps allow planters to verify tree planting and tree survival with geo-tagged, time-stamped images. 
- A data pipeline and and database for field data ingestion
- A data analysis pipeline including: Admin panel for aging Tree capture details and user management, machine learning data analysis, and script based data analysis. Tree images and data points are analyzed using the treetracker-admin-client.
- A web map, the treetracker-web-map-client, at Treetracker.org displays trees and can be embedded on partner websites, allowing the partnerâ€™s clients to see their planted and mapped trees. 
- A wallet System and Tools for trading the Greenstand Impact tokens. Using a secure wallet and wallet-api system users create/register wallets and transfer tokens. Each Greenstand Impact Token is based on a verified ecological impact, such as growing trees.
- A Digital Herbarium
- API's for token transfers, data exports etc.
