# Meeting 2

**Meeting Notes**

Standardized directory structure and component architecture, across teams.

* Identify parent views, and what the hierarchy is
* Identify individual components
* Where to handle state
* Suggest that we use a file system structure that follows the architecture and data flow of the app.
  * Create a mental model for the app.
  * What do we have here and what are the pieces _where is the stuff for the stuff_
  * Do this for all 3 React apps in Treetracker
* Identify new structure refactoring as a technical debt to chip away at.

Consider 'backend of the frontend' development

* More experienced developer provides hooks to complex models in easy ways for new developers.
* API access patterns that frontend developers can easily leverage.

Next Steps

* Create a draft architecture document containing a recommendation for standardized directory structure, and 'backend of the frontend'
* Review this document with the Treetracker React.js community.
* Josh and Nick will collaborate to create the first draft of this document.
