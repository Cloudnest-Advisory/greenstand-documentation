# Communicating the Project

### **Follow** [**this link**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mdr8K\_JDAsf8gUAHkotoICGQqgP7WBo4/view?usp=sharing) **to read Greenstand’s full Communication Policy.**

### Terminology&#xD;

* Our tagline: **Technology for sustainable reforestation and poverty alleviation.**
* **Capture**: a tree photo capture and its associated data package, including verifiable ground-truthed impact data
  * **Verified**: describing a tree that has been captured and tracked by Greenstand
*  **Greenstand**, not GreenStand or Green Stand
* **Treetracker**, not TreeTracker or Tree Tracker; can refer to the app or system users
* **Open-source**, not open source
* **Pay-to-grow:** a system of paying tree growers on a regular basis to plant and care for trees; our pay-to-grow system is implemented by our partner Fairtree.
* **Contributors:** the volunteers that make up Greenstand; we also use the phrases Greenstanders or members of the Greenstand community.
* **Impact Wallet:** token-wallet mechanism within the Treetracker platform&#x20;
* **Impact Token:** digital representation of the capture value of each tracked tree; Impact Tokens can be sold or traded with other Impact Wallet owners.
  * **Proof of work**: a term describing how tree photo captures represent an event that occured at a singular moment in time; these do not represent future impact status.&#x20;
* **Tree growers** rather than tree planters. Planting is a one-time event with an uncertain outcome. Growing emphasizes the time and effort required to sustain new trees. Can also be referred to as tree farmers, stewards, Treetrackers, system users. When in doubt, ask the communications team!
  * We **enable** tree growers to pull themselves and their communities out of poverty by growing and tracking trees, but we don’t **empower** them, as that suggests Greenstand has power to give in the first place.&#x20;
  * We **pay** or **compensate** tree growers, but we **don’t employ** them. That is the responsibility of the planting organization; Greenstand simply facilitates payments.&#x20;
  * We **avoid the term poor**. Instead, we prefer to use more articulate phrases such as **impoverished**, **marginalized,** or **economically disadvantaged**.
