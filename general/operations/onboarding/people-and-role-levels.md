# People & Role Levels

All new **volunteers enter as Contributors** because we know **every volunteer makes a contribution.**

When we say **#LetsGrowTogether**, we mean more than just trees. Greenstand strives to support the professional and personal development of every contributor who enters the space.

In order to accelerate Greenstandâ€™s mission, we define roles & titles that will best facilitate organizing our teams and decision making.

## Role Elevation

**Lead** and **Coordinator** roles are reserved for individuals that have made outstanding contributions to the project and desire **leadership opportunities** and **experience**.

Follow this link to view the [**Community page**](https://greenstand.org/greenstand/community) on our website where we showcase our **Core Contributors**, or those who have **dedicated 50+ hours**, accelerated major project work, or **volunteered for 2 years or more**.&#x20;

Once elevated to Core Contributor or Lead, we will request a **bio** & **professional headshot** for this page. Additionally, once given an **official title,** we request that you **add that title to your Slack display name**.
