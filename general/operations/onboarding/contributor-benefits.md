# Contributor Benefits

**Learn New Skills**

We seek to offer opportunities for professional and personal growth at every juncture. Volunteering with Greenstand is a fantastic way to learn new skills that you can apply to other areas of your life, both personal and professional. You can build the skills required to land your dream job, especially if you don’t have a ton of work experience. These can be both hard and soft skills.

#### Build You Resume

If you are new to coding or ready to take the next jump in your career, contributing to an open-source software project is an excellent opportunity to build a resume, add to your portfolio, and get the stellar recommendations that make you stand out in a competitive workforce!&#x20;

**Expand Your Network**

One of the greatest things about volunteering with Greenstand is the ability to meet new people. We have a diverse global team of compassionate, friendly contributors that are waiting to welcome you! We are happy to serve as a professional reference for you. Upon request, we can provide a letter verifying your volunteer hours and projects.

**Have a Positive Impact**

The time and work you will put into the Greenstand project can go a long way and have a huge positive impact on the lives of others and the environment. Volunteering for such an impactful project enhances your sense of purpose and self esteem. Check out our Contributor Spotlight series on our [blog](http://greenstand.org/blog) to find out more about the Greenstand experience!

**Opportunity to Lead**

Become a leader here. Greenstand is built by an endless stream of energy from talented contributors.&#x20;

Where you are ready to lead the charge on a single issue or take on an entire microservice - we need your help directing that energy to solve real challenges.&#x20;
