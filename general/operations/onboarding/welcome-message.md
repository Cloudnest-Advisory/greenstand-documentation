## **Welcome to Greenstand!**

Is your motivation climate change or poverty? We all have our reasons to be here. Maybe you want to be part of an awesome project or maybe you just got a ticket and owe community service. I can’t answer what brought you here - I can only speak for myself.

I once held a stranger's hand when he died. I’d brought him to a hospital and was saying goodbye, wishing him luck and that was it - he died. Thinking back on that moment, it leaves a good feeling knowing I’d done everything I could to help him. It was good to be there with him as his friend in his last terrifying struggle.

I find it fulfilling to help people. Making the world a better place brings me joy - it makes me feel good. It is painful and depressing to stand by and do nothing while people suffer and we collectively destroy our planet.

There are hundreds of millions of amazing people on our planet who live on less than a dollar or two a day and are caught in a perpetual struggle to find food. Basic education is not an option - healthcare is less of a priority when you are starving. I've seen it. I've witnessed the plight of a single mother in rural Africa, and Central or South America. It makes me angry - I cannot and will not stand by and do nothing.

For me, Greenstand is a social project. It’s answering the needs of the most powerful climate activists this planet has. If we support that woman in her struggle, she, together with her neighbors and millions of others like her, will clean our atmosphere; they will build the most effective climate solution possible - forests.

Regardless of why you are here, I am excited to welcome you to a growing and powerful community. We are on this planet together and we are not just standing by. We have a plan; we are making it happen. And we need you.

Thank you for joining.
