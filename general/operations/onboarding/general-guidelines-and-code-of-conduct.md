### **Confidentiality Clause**

Respecting the privacy of our clients, donors, members, staff, volunteers and of Greenstand itself is a basic value of Greenstand.

Personal and financial information pertaining to Greenstand or any of its associated organizations or clients is confidential and should not be disclosed or discussed with anyone without permission or authorization from David Ezra Jay, the President and Executive Director. Care shall also be taken to ensure that individuals with access to sensitive information keep this information private and that sharing permissions providing access to documents containing confidential information are shared only with permission from the Executive Director or the Board of Directors.

Employees, volunteers and board members of Greenstand may be exposed to information which is confidential and/or privileged and proprietary in nature. It is the policy of Greenstand that such information must be kept confidential both during and after employment or volunteer service. Staff and volunteers, including board members, can expect to have permissions removed that once provided direct access to online databases containing privileged or confidential information after the time of separation from employment or expiration of service.

Unauthorized disclosure of confidential or privileged information is a serious violation of this policy and will subject the person(s) who made the unauthorized disclosure to appropriate discipline at the discretion of the Executive Director or Board of Directors.

### **Non-Discrimination Policy**

As stated in the overview section, Greenstand does not unlawfully discriminate internally (in its administrative and program operations) or externally (in its recipients of services) on the basis of race, political orientation, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, national or social origin, ancestry, economic or social status, place of residence, marital or family status, veteran status, health status, or mental or physical disability.

### **Abusive Comments**

Abusive comments likely include spam, are off-topic, promote services or products, are false or misleading, are unsupported accusations, obscene, vulgar, defamatory, profane, libelous, threatening, bullying, harassing, abusive, hateful, incite violence, or are offensive terms that target specific ethnic, racial or religious groups based on gender or sexual identity or individuals because of membership in those groups. These kinds of comments should be documented and removed or reported. Repeat offenders may be blocked from engaging further with Greenstand on social media.

## **Greenstand Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Policy**

Greenstand does not unlawfully discriminate internally (in its administrative and program operations) or externally (in its recipients of services) on the basis of race, political orientation, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, national or social origin, ancestry, economic or social status, place of residence, marital or family status, veteran status, health status, or mental or physical disability. Contributors of diverse backgrounds and life experiences are what makes Greenstand special; all you need is stable WIFI and a willingness to learn!
