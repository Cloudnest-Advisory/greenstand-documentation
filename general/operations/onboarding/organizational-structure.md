# Organizational Structure

Greenstand is governed by a Board of Directors who each invaluable bring professional expertise to the organization. Our board is highlighted on the [**Board page**](https://greenstand.org/greenstand/board) of our website.

Greenstand currently has four divisions: **Engineering**, **Operations**, **Programs** and **Finance**. Each division is led by a VP who collaborates with the President on the high-level organizational decisions. In every division, team leads and contributors work together with support of the VP.
