# Document Creation & Archiving

### **Content Review Process**

Each division at Greenstand follows a review process for documents and other content. It starts with drafting and posting the content for review in relevant Slack channels. After applying edits and feedback, the document should repost and get at least 2 approvals other than the channel lead. Final approval is indicated by reacting to the Slack post with a “thumbs up” emoji.

&#x20;        &#x20;
