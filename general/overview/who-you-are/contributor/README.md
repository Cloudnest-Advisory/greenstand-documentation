### Welcome Message

<details>

<summary>Is your motivation climate change or poverty? We all have our reasons to be here. Maybe you want to be part of an awesome project or...</summary>

maybe you just got a ticket and owe community service. I can’t answer what brought you here - I can only speak for myself.

I once brought someone to a hospital. I wishing for a speedy recovery, saying goodbye, and still holding a warm hand when that stranger died. Thinking back, it leaves a good feeling knowing I’d done everything I could to help. I find it fulfilling to help people. It was good to be there as a stranger, as a friend in someone's last struggle. Making the world a better place brings me joy - it makes me feel good. It is painful and depressing to stand by and do nothing while people suffer and we collectively destroy our planet.

There are hundreds of millions of amazing people on our planet who live on less than I spend on a cup of coffee - they are caught in a perpetual struggle to find food. Basic education is not an option - healthcare is not a priority when you are starving. I've seen it. I've witnessed the plight of a single mother in rural Africa. I've seen the story of a single mom in Central and South America. I understand how our actions in the "developed world" drive climate change and make their lives, the poorest people's lives that much harder. It makes me angry - I cannot and will not stand by and do nothing.

For me, Greenstand is a social project. It’s answering the needs of the most powerful climate activists this planet has. If we support that woman in her struggle, she, together with her neighbors and millions of others like her, will clean our atmosphere; they will build the most effective climate solution possible - forests.

Regardless of why you are here, I am excited to welcome you to a growing and powerful community. We are on this planet together and we are not just standing by. We have a plan; we are making it happen. And we need you.

Thank you for joining.

## Your FIRST TASK:

2. Understand the technology Greenstand is creating. Map.treetracker.org, you can also view apps, and other dashboards - find a problem to report and if you can't find where or who to report it to ask.
3. Improve documentation - if you got stuck or lost it is mostly a documentation issue! Improving documentation is critical to our success and is great first github commit to the project. [Documentation on documenaion](https://docs.greenstand.org/meta-documentation/how-to-contribute-documenation)
