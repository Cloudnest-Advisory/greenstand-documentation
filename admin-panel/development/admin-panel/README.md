# Overview

## About the Admin Panel

The Admin Panel is a tool used by Greenstand and partner organizations to review and manage the following data:

* **Trees**
* **Captures** (geo- and time-stamped photos of trees)
* Tree **Species**
* **Growers** (AKA Planters or Workers)
* **Contracts** (agreements between Growers and organizations)
* Grower **Earnings** and **Payments**
* **Stakeholders** (e.g., tree planting organizations)
* **Regions** (geographical areas where planting happens)

Additionally, the Admin Panel provides a mechanism for sending messages and surveys to Treetracker app users (**Messaging**).

### Primary Use Case

Tree **Captures** recorded by **Growers** through the [Treetracker app](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/-MXNadx4i6aOZ12XcStA/s/-MXtAguKaWMpiXXl0UDb/) appear in the Admin Panel for **verification** (_is it a photo of a tree?_), **tagging** (_what sort of tree is it?_) and **matching** (_is the tree already being tracked?_).

### Secondary Use Case

Manage the **Contracts** under which **Growers** plant and track trees on behalf of tree planting organizations (**Stakeholders**). Manage the **Payments** from organizations to Growers for fulfilling the contract.
