# Payment Module

The payment module will list payments made under the contracts. Payments are for verified captures only. Once a capture has been paid for the payment ID will get added to the individual capture. The payments will be invoked by an operator and then go through the process described under [External Payment Processing](../offline-workflows/offline-payment-processing.md).
