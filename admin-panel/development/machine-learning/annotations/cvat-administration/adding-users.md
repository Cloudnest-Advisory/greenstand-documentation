# Adding Users

First, make sure your account has admin access. If you need this, contact Shubhom (shubhom.bhattacharya@greenstand.org) or another admin.&#x20;

Once you've logged in, go to the Admin page in the dropdown menu next to your username on the top right of the landing page.

This takes you to the administation landing page. If you're unable to see this, it might mean you don't have the proper permissions.&#x20;

Click on "Add" or "Change" next to "Users" under "Authentication and Authorization" if you want to add a new user or modify a user that already exists.

To add a user, you just need to know what username and password they require. Add these accordingly. It's helpful to use a site like [passwordgenerator.net ](http://www.passwordgenerator.net)to choose a secure password.&#x20;

Communicate these to the user via email or Slack.&#x20;
