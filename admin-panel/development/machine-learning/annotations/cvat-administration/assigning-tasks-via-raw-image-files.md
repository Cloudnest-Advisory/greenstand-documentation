First, in the CVAT menu, Click "Create new task"

This will take you to the task creation page. You can enter the task name: for example, "intro task a". You also select which project the task belongs to. Selecting the project is important because this will automatically load the relevant labels for the task.&#x20;

You can upload the Images by clicking on the "Click or drag files to this area" box. Select the image files relevant for the task. Nothing needs to be configured in the advanced settings- you can simply hit submit after the upload.&#x20;

After the task is created, a pop-up appears on the top-right. This is the easiest away to access a blank task. Click "Open task". If you miss the popup, the main "Tasks" page will show the most recently created task first, so you can click on that. Make sure to assign it because unassigned tasks are displayed for all annotators.

Next, you can fill out the "Assigned to" field to specify which user will complete the task. The "Assignee" field is your username. Lastly, the "Reviewer" field will be the username of the person who will perform revisions. The task is now ready for annotation.&#x20;
