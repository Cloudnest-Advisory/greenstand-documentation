# GreenDocs
Documentation, how-to, guides, references for Greenstand and its Treetracker software.

index.htm provides an annotated list of links.

Those links can point to our documentation, whether it's on gitbook,
greenstand.com, or anywhere else.

## Environment & Installation: 

This is a simple collection of *.html, *.css, and *.js files.

They are meant to reside at support.greenstand.org or https://greenstand.org/docs
They do not require any particular server-side environment.

Clone them to most any directory on most any HTTP server.

```/_private```, ```/_swagger```, and any other file ```/_*```  
is meant to be password-protected by whatever means the server provides.

While some of the documents are private, the index's descriptions and links
to the private documents are not themselves private. Authorization is the responsibility of whatever system hosts a given document.
